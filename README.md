## Technical Details & tools

We are using Farcaster Frames to create the ai agent. Frameworks used:
- frog(https://frog.fm/) to create frames
- langchain/langgraph as the agent
- AI model is openai gpt-4o

There are also 2 contracts deployed(They are deployed on Sepolia since the hackthon time is limited and frog doesn't support Cyber yet, will fix this in the future).
