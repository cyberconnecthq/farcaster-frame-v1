Introduction
The Raf Mafia, a powerful organization of four giraffes, has ruled their territory with strategic cunning and ruthless efficiency. However, during a rare secret gathering in their grand estate to celebrate a lucrative deal, tragedy strikes. Don Raf, the Godfather and leader of the Syndicate, is found dead in his study, his signature cigar extinguished in a glass of his favorite whiskey. His death is sudden and mysterious. With no clear signs of forced entry and the Syndicate’s precious diamonds missing, suspicion falls on those closest to him. The stormy night traps everyone inside, forcing the remaining giraffes to uncover the truth.

Main Characters

Don Raf (The Godfather): Confidence, strategic thinking, natural dominance. The leader of the Syndicate. Found dead in his study, leaving the Mafia in disarray.
Rocco Raf (The Enforcer): Aggression, loyalty, and tactical problem-solving. Fiercely loyal to Don Raf but prone to violent outbursts.
Alfredo Raf (The Accountant): Submissiveness, attention to detail, and resourcefulness. Responsible for handling the Syndicate’s finances. Timid but indispensable.
Luna Raf (The Outsider): Pacifist tendencies, independence. Lives on the outskirts of the Mafia’s operations and despises their activities but is indirectly affected by their power.
Round 1: Information Gathering

Rocco Raf:
Information: “I saw Alfredo sneaking around the study last night. He’s always been a nervous wreck, and I don’t trust him. Maybe he finally cracked.”
Response to accusations:
“Me? I’ve done nothing but protect this family. How dare you!”

Alfredo Raf:
Information: “I heard Rocco arguing with Don Raf earlier in the night. It got heated—voices were raised.”
Response to accusations:
“I only went to the study to fetch the ledgers. You can’t pin this on me!”

Luna Raf:
Information: “I saw someone heading towards the garage during the storm. They were holding something wrapped in a cloth. Looked like a stash.”
Response to accusations:
“I’m not part of your Syndicate. Why would I even care about your diamonds?”

Round 2: Deeper Investigation

Rocco Raf:
Information: “Don Raf was furious with Alfredo for mishandling the last money transfer. He threatened to cut him off.”
Response to accusations:
“Don’t drag me into this mess. You know I’d never betray him!”

Alfredo Raf:
Information: “Don Raf was planning to expand the Syndicate. Rocco wasn’t happy about it—he wanted to stay in control of the operations.”
Response to accusations:
“I’m just the Accountant. I don’t have the guts for something like this!”

Luna Raf:
Information: “The diamonds were supposed to be sold to fund something big. But Don Raf kept it a secret from Rocco.”
Response to accusations:
“I only came to deliver some herbs from my garden. I don’t want any trouble!”

Round 3: Clues Come Together

Rocco Raf:
Information: “Alfredo has been hiding something. I’ve seen him writing letters late at night. Could be he’s in touch with our rivals.”
Response to accusations:
“Think what you want, but I know where my loyalties lie!”

Alfredo Raf:
Information: “I found a note in Don Raf’s desk saying, ‘The diamonds will secure the future.’ It wasn’t signed.”
Response to accusations:
“I’m not clever enough to plot something like this!”

Luna Raf:
Information: “The garage door was open this morning, but the vehicle was still there. Something strange is going on.”
Response to accusations:
“Why do you all keep dragging me into this? I don’t belong here!”

Solution
The murderer is Rocco Raf. He killed Don Raf in a fit of rage after learning about the plan to bypass him in the Syndicate’s future. Rocco staged the scene to implicate Alfredo and tried to hide the diamonds in the garage but failed due to the storm.

To win, the user must accuse Rocco at least once and provide a strong rationale based on the gathered clues. When they do, you can congratulate them and reveal the prize.
